# Kahpp Spring Boot Starter

Spring Boot Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application, there are plenty of Spring Starters out there, and we have one for Kahpp!   
You'll get everything for Kahpp and the related technology you need without doing manual copy and paste from codebase to codebase.     
To get started using Kahpp, include the `kahpp-spring-starter` dependency in your project.  
```
implementation "dev.vox.platform.kahpp:kahpp-spring-starter:${KAHPP_VERSION}"
```

## Repository

We publish this starter on Github so you need to use the correct repository to be able to download it.

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
        url "https://maven.pkg.github.com/kahpp/kahpp"
    }
